## Usage

To use in Observable,

```javascript
forEachGraphemeCluster = require( 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-for-each-grapheme-cluster@umd/browser.js' )
```

To vendor stdlib functionality and avoid installing dependency trees for Node.js, you can use the UMD server build:

```javascript
var forEachGraphemeCluster = require( 'path/to/vendor/umd/string-base-for-each-grapheme-cluster/index.js' )
```

To include the bundle in a webpage,

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/string-base-for-each-grapheme-cluster@umd/browser.js"></script>
```

If no recognized module system is present, access bundle contents via the global scope:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
(function () {
    window.forEachGraphemeCluster;
})();
</script>
```

#### forEachGraphemeCluster( str, clbk\[, thisArg ] )

Invokes a function for each grapheme cluster (i.e., user-perceived character) in a string.

```javascript
function log( value, index ) {
    console.log( '%d: %s', index, value );
}

forEachGraphemeCluster( 'Beep!', log );
/* =>
    0: B
    1: e
    2: e
    3: p
    4: !
*/
```

The invoked function is provided three arguments:

-   **value**: grapheme cluster.
-   **index**: starting grapheme cluster index.
-   **str**: input string.

To set the function execution context, provide a `thisArg`.

```javascript
function clbk() {
    this.count += 1;
}

var str = '👉🏿';

var ctx = {
    'count': 0
};

forEachGraphemeCluster( str, clbk, ctx );

var cnt = ctx.count;
// returns 1
```
